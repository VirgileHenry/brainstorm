Then each player randomly selects a nonland, non-colorless _Magic_ card from their own cards without revealing it to the rest of the players. Shuffle all players' remaining cards together and place the stack face down in the center of all players. Each player's selected card is their wedding *theme*, and they may secretly look at their own card at any time. Each player is dealt 4 cards, then turn over the top card of the stack to create a discard pile. Randomly determine who goes first. Then take turns counterclockwise.\nLET'S PLAY:\nPlayers take turns drawing and discarding cards, trying to create a hand of cards with the highest point value. Players may draw the top card of the deck *OR* pick up *any* card from the discard pile. If a card is taken from the discard pile, they must *take every card discarded on top of that card* as well.
